# GitLab2023
**This is a repository containing a lab that helps to practice using Git**
The code consists of a **_print statment_**, which is used as a test to learn how to commit and push code.
The files included themselves are very short and simple since the purpose of the lab is to learn how **Git** works, not how Java and Eclipse work.
There's not much else to say about this repository.
